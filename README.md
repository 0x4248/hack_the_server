# Hack the server

A group of premade servers that you can hack

> **Note:**
> Only for educational purposes. Do not use this on any server that you do not have permission to use it on.

## Target

Try and get the flag from the server the flag looks like this:

```
AB12345678CD
```

It will be random of course but it will always be 12 characters long and have 2 letters at the start and 2 at the end.

## How to use

On your computer cd into the `servers` directory and then you will see a README.md file that will have the name of each server.

Inside each server folder there is a makefile. Run this to start the server and then you can connect to it trough port `5040`.

## How to get the flag

You need to find a way to get the flag from the server. You can do this by exploiting the server in some way. If you cant figure this out you can look at the source code of the server to see how it works or read solution.md to see how to do it.

The name of the server should give you a hint on how to exploit it.
