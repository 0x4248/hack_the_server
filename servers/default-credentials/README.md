# Default Credentials

Ever wondered what would happen if you left the default credentials on a server? Well, wonder no more! This server has a login page with a default username and password. Can you find it?

## Prerequisites

You will need:
- Python
- Flask
- Make

## How to use

Run the makefile to start the server. Then connect to it on port `5040`. If the makefile fails you may need to change `PYTHON=python3` to `PYTHON=python` in the makefile.
