# Robots

Wonder how robots ever know where to go? Well, they have a map of the world. They know where to go and where not to. Try and find the robots map and see if you can find the flag.

## Prerequisites

You will need:
- Python
- Flask
- Make

## How to use

Run the makefile to start the server. Then connect to it on port `5040`. If the makefile fails you may need to change `PYTHON=python3` to `PYTHON=python` in the makefile.
