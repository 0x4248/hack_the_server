Dogs are real good sniffers. So are computers. Try and find the flag.

## Prerequisites

You will need:
- Python
- Flask
- Make

## How to use

Run the makefile to start the server. Then connect to it on port `5040`. If the makefile fails you may need to change `PYTHON=python3` to `PYTHON=python` in the makefile.
